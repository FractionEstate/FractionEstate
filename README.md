# Fraction Estate AS

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **Fraction Estate AS** â€“ your gateway to accessible, transparent, and innovative real estate investment through blockchain-powered fractional ownership.

## About Fraction Estate

Fraction Estate AS is a pioneering RealFi platform revolutionizing real estate investment by leveraging blockchain technology. Our mission is to democratize property investment, allowing anyone to buy, sell, and earn from real-world assets-fractionally, securely, and efficiently[2][4].

We use the Cardano blockchain to tokenize physical properties, turning them into tradable digital assets (NFTs). This approach eliminates traditional barriers, reduces costs, and provides global access to real estate markets[2][4].

## Why Fractional Ownership?

Fractional ownership enables multiple investors to collectively own a share of high-value assets-such as real estate-without the need for significant capital outlay. Each investor holds a portion of the asset and shares the benefits, including rental income and potential appreciation[1][3].

**Key Benefits:**
- Lower entry barriers to real estate investment
- Diversification across property types and locations
- Transparent, blockchain-based ownership records
- Passive income through rental yield distribution
- Liquidity via a marketplace for trading fractional NFTs[1][2][4]

## How Fraction Estate Works

Our process makes real estate investment seamless and secure:

1. **Property Acquisition:** We establish a dedicated corporation to acquire each property.
2. **Tokenization:** Ownership shares are converted into unique NFTs, each representing a fraction of the property.
3. **Marketplace Listing:** Tokenized properties are listed on our marketplace for investors to explore and purchase.
4. **KYC & Compliance:** Investors complete KYC checks to ensure regulatory compliance and eligibility for rental distributions.
5. **Property Management:** Fraction Estate handles all property operations, maintenance, and tenant relations.
6. **Yield Distribution:** Rental income and profits are distributed to NFT holders in FET tokens, proportionate to their ownership[2].

## Property Categories

We offer diverse investment opportunities tailored to different risk and return profiles:

- **Low Yield:** Stable residential properties with existing tenants
- **Medium Yield:** Underdeveloped residential or commercial properties, including fix-and-flip projects
- **High Yield:** Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO), new builds, or shared office spaces with higher risk and return potential[2]

## Our Vision

We believe the next major disruption in finance is the tokenization of real-world assets. By bridging traditional real estate with blockchain, we empower a broader audience to participate in property investment, fostering inclusivity, transparency, and financial freedom[2].
