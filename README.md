## About Fraction Estate

Fraction Estate AS is a pioneering RealFi platform revolutionizing real estate investment by leveraging blockchain technology. Our mission is to democratize property investment, allowing anyone to buy, sell, and earn from real-world assets-fractionally, securely, and efficiently.

We use the Cardano blockchain to tokenize physical properties, turning them into tradable digital assets (NFTs). This approach eliminates traditional barriers, reduces costs, and provides global access to real estate markets.

## Why Fractional Ownership?

Fractional ownership enables multiple investors to collectively own a share of high-value assets-such as real estate-without the need for significant capital outlay. Each investor holds a portion of the asset and shares the benefits, including rental income and potential appreciation.

**Key Benefits:**
- Lower entry barriers to real estate investment
- Diversification across property types and locations
- Transparent, blockchain-based ownership records
- Passive income through rental yield distribution
- Liquidity via a marketplace for trading fractional NFTs

## How Fraction Estate Works

Our process makes real estate investment seamless and secure:

1. **Property Acquisition:** We establish a dedicated corporation to acquire each property.
2. **Tokenization:** Ownership shares are converted into unique NFTs, each representing a fraction of the property.
3. **Marketplace Listing:** Tokenized properties are listed on our marketplace for investors to explore and purchase.
4. **KYC & Compliance:** Investors complete KYC checks to ensure regulatory compliance and eligibility for rental distributions.
5. **Property Management:** Fraction Estate handles all property operations, maintenance, and tenant relations.
6. **Yield Distribution:** Rental income and profits are distributed to NFT holders in FET tokens, proportionate to their ownership.

## Property Categories

We offer diverse investment opportunities tailored to different risk and return profiles:

- **Low Yield:** Stable residential properties with existing tenants
- **Medium Yield:** Underdeveloped residential or commercial properties, including fix-and-flip projects
- **High Yield:** Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO), new builds, or shared office spaces with higher risk and return potential

---

## Our Vision

We believe the next major disruption in finance is the tokenization of real-world assets. By bridging traditional real estate with blockchain, we empower a broader audience to participate in property investment, fostering inclusivity, transparency, and financial freedom.
